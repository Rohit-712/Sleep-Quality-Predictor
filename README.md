# Sleep-Quality-Predictor

In today’s fast-paced world, sleep is often sacrificed — but what if you could predict your sleep quality based on your daily habits?

I built a Machine Learning model using Python that predicts whether your sleep quality was Good, Average, or Poor, based on your everyday lifestyle factors.

🔍 Problem Statement
Understanding sleep quality is crucial for health and productivity. Using key daily habits, this project aims to predict sleep quality to encourage better life choices.

📊 Features Used
The model predicts sleep quality based on:

🛌 Sleep Duration

📱 Screen Time

🚶 Steps Walked

😖 Stress Level

💧 Water Intake

🧠 Model Details
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: Achieved over 90% accuracy on the test dataset

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Rohit-712/Sleep-Quality-Predictor
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

📈 Results
The model successfully predicts sleep quality with high accuracy.

Insights from feature importance show that stress level and screen time have a significant impact on sleep quality.

🌟 Future Improvements
Collect a larger and more diverse dataset

Build a real-time sleep quality tracker app

Add more features like caffeine intake, workout intensity, etc.
